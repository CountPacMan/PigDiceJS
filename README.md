### Date: April 15, 2015
#### Description
This web app allows two users to play a game of Pig Dice against each other.

######Pig Dice Rules

Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a dice until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":

If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.

If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.

If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.

The first player to score 100 or more points wins.
